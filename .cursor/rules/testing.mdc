## Directory Structure

- **Unit tests**: Located alongside source files using `__tests__/`, using `.test.ts`
- **Integration tests**: Located under `${ROOT}/__tests__`, using `.integration.test.ts`
- **Fixtures**: Located in `__tests__/__fixtures__/`

## File Organization

Tests should follow this clear order depending on requirements:

1. Imports
2. Mocks
3. Test data
4. Setup (beforeAll then beforeEach)
5. Cleanup (afterEach then afterAll)
6. Test suites (`describe`)

## Naming Conventions

- Unit tests: `[component-name].test.ts`
- Integration tests: `[use-case-name].test.ts`

## Test Structure

- `describe`
- `test` statements clearly structured (replace it keyword by test)

## Dependencies

- vitest (latest)
- vitest-mock-extended (latest)
- mockdate (latest)
- mswjs for mocking api calls (latest)

## Best Practices

- Write tests following Given/When/Then clearly with
  // Given: A small description
  // When: A small description
  // Then: A small description
- Focus on testing behavior, not code implementation
- Keep tests fast, isolated, and maintainable
- Clearly differentiate between expected and unexpected errors

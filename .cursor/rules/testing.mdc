## Directory Structure
- **Unit tests**: Located alongside source files using `.spec.ts`
- **Integration tests**: Located under `__tests__/integration`, using `.test.ts`
- **End-to-End tests**: Located under `__tests__/e2e`, using `.e2e.ts`
- **Fixtures**: Located in `__tests__/__fixtures__/`

## File Organization
Tests should follow this clear structure:
- Imports
- Mocks
- Test data
- Setup (beforeAll/beforeEach)
- Test suites (`describe`)
- Cleanup (afterAll/afterEach)

## Naming Conventions
- Unit tests: `[component-name].spec.ts`
- Integration tests: `[use-case-name].test.ts`
- E2E tests: `[scenario-name].e2e.ts`

## Test Structure
- **Unit tests**:
  - `describe`
  - `beforeEach`
  - `it` (individual test cases)
- **Integration/E2E tests**:
  - `describe`
  - `beforeAll` and `afterAll` for setup and teardown
  - `it` statements clearly structured with "it should"

## Dependencies
- Jest (latest)
- ts-jest (latest)
- jest-mock-extended (latest)

## Best Practices
- Write tests following Given/When/Then clearly
- Keep tests fast, isolated, and maintainable
- Clearly differentiate between expected and unexpected errors
